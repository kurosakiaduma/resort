# Dytopia Resort
This project is about a resort that I gave the name **Dytopia**. The idea was to create a website for the resort and add a couple of features on to it.

Some of the things that I have included that range within the HTML and Bootstrap code include the *jumbotron* and *marquee features*.

### Prequisites
1. You **need a Github account** to clone the project directory from my repository.

1. The webpage needs to be run on **Google Chrome** browser. It's okay to use any other web browser but I reccommend Chrome because of it's extensive extensions that allow some of the extra features I threw into the page to function well.

1. To view the raw code of the webpage you will probably need a text editor e..g **Atom** or **Brackets**

1. You will also need to obtain Bootstrap file css from [getbootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)


### Installing
* Using your **Terminal**, you will need to clone/fork the repository containing the root folder to your computer using this command: $ git clone https://github.com/resort/rebuild

OR

* Directly download the root folder to your computer using [this link](https://github.com/kurosakiaduma/resort/archive/master.zip)

## Deployment
1. After unpacking the contents, use **Atom** to open the **HTML** **CSS**and **Bootstrap** to view the source code of the project.

1. Run the project in Google Chrome **(reccommended)** or any other web browser to view it in deployed version.

1. Test the project live by editing its source code using **Google Developer Tools**.

## Built with
