        <p>Conch salad by the sea with a Kalik, award-winning fine dining in an historical mansion, burgers while watching the game, to mangoes freshly picked from the tree: the variety of culinary choices and settings offers something perfect for all tastes, budgets and occasions. While everything from French to Italian or Asian-fusion is available on the island, Bahamian cuisine offers a full cultural adventure.</p>

<p>Bahamian cuisine centers on the oceans’ bounty combining Spanish, West African and British tastes and styles. Conch (pronounced ‘konk’), Crawfish (rock lobster), Grouper, Red Snapper and crab are local favorites. Conch is a mollusk with firm white flesh that is prepared in a variety of ways including conch salad, conch fritters, cracked conch, and conch chowder. Other specialties include boiled fish and grits for breakfast, Bahamian stew fish, crawfish with peas ‘n’ rice and Johnny cake. For dessert, try fresh tropical fruit, guava duff, pineapple or coconut tart, and bread pudding. If you would like to take a full journey through Bahamian cuisine, ask us about the excellent food tours.</p>

<p>There are many restaurant options available on island. We have listed some of the Sandyport area restaurants below. Our concierge team though is truly connected and can assist you with making reservations throughout the island.
